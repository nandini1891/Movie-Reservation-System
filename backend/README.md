# Movie Reservation System — Admin Backend Module

Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose) backend covering the **admin** side of the
Movie Reservation System: movie management, theater/screen management,
showtime management, and read-only booking oversight.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET
npm run dev             # or: npm start
```

## Making your first admin

Registration always creates a `user` role. Promote an existing account to admin:

```bash
node scripts/makeAdmin.js someone@example.com
```

## Auth

`POST /api/auth/register` and `POST /api/auth/login` return a JWT.
Send it on every admin request as:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Admin Endpoints (all require an admin JWT)

## Notes for the team

- **Seat map**: generated automatically when a showtime is created, based on the
  screen's `rows` × `seatsPerRow`. Labels look like `A1, A2, ... B1, B2...`.
- **Booking creation/cancellation and the seat-hold/checkout flow are NOT in this
  module** — that's the user-facing booking part. This module only reads
  `Booking` and toggles seat `blocked` status for maintenance.
- **Overlap check**: creating a showtime rejects it if the screen already has
  another showtime overlapping that time window.
- Swap `middleware/auth.js` for whatever the team's shared auth ends up being —
  it only needs to attach `req.user` with a `role` field for `isAdmin` to work.
